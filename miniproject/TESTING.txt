The programme takes three arguments: asset file, correlation file, a number(whether short sell or not, 1=shortsell. 0=no shortsell)

The programme will be test with the following test case:

1.Asset file contains fewer asset info than correlation file.
2.Correlation file contain fewer asset infor than asset file.
3.Both file have same assets but in different asset order.
4.Correlation file include a correlation matrix that is not square (nCol<nRow);
5.One of the rows of correlation matrix has incomplete elements.
6.Invalid input format (e.g. space seperated, no '%');

The programme should detect the above-mentioned invalid input.

Other test case:

1. input files with larger or smaller size.
2. enlarge the range of ROR searching.
